% Identify parameter regimes of different polarity site dynamics.

% Inputs:
% n_Cdc42: total number of Cdc42.
% BemGEF_list: a wider range of Bem1-GEF used to generate the bifurcation 
% diagram.
% seeds: initialize a random number generator.
% standard_num_K: number of Ripley's K values produced from each simulation. 
% Each simulation should have 201 K values so standard_num_K = 201*10*2 = 
% 4020 here.
% K_values_path: The file path of K values. There are two paths:
% '../K_values/2DCombinedPolarity' contains K values from the 2D combined
% polarity circuit model simulations.
% '../K_values/2DCorePolarity' contains K values from the 2D core polariy
% circuit model simulations.

% Outputs:
% unpolarized_regime: index of the unpolarized regime.
% transient_polarity_regime: index of the transient polarity regime.
% polarized_regime: index of the polarized regime.
% simulated_K_diff: Difference between K>=1.5 and K<1.5 estimated from a 
% sigmoidal function.
% K_diff: Difference between K>=1.5 and K<1.5 calculated from particle-based 
% simulations. It is used as data points to fit the sigmoidal function for 
% estimating the relation between difference in K and number of Bem1-GEF.
% n_BemGEF: total number of Bem1-GEF in the particle-based simulations.

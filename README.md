Add the "Dependencies" to the MATLAB path.

The folder "FigureData" contains x and/or y values of the figure.
The folder "Coordinates" contains coordinates of molecules in the particle-based simulations.
The folder "K_values" contains Ripley's K function values calculated from the molecular coordinates generated by particle-based simulations at a particular number of Cdc42.
For example, "K_1800.mat" contains the values of K generated by simulations with 1800 Cdc42.
